        <hr><h2>Card Meaning and Analysis</h2>
        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Inner Strength and Resilience</div>
            <div class="text">Strength is a card that embodies courage, not as an outward display of power, but as inner fortitude. 
                It suggests that even though you may be going through a difficult time, you have the mental and emotional strength to rise above it. 
                Job loss can be a hard blow, but Strength reminds you that you have the resources within yourself to handle adversity.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Patience and Calm</div>
            <div class="text">This card often signifies a need for patience and composure in the face of challenges. 
                Instead of rushing to find the first job opportunity or reacting impulsively, 
                the Strength card asks you to approach the situation with calm and clarity. Patience with yourself and the process is key, 
                as good things will come when you stay grounded.

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Self-Compassion and Kindness</div>
            <div class="text">Strength also represents compassion and understanding, particularly toward yourself. 
                It encourages you to treat yourself with kindness during this time of transition. Losing a job can affect your self-esteem, 
                but Strength reminds you to remain compassionate toward yourself and to believe in your ability to bounce back.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Overcoming Fears and Doubts</div>
            <div class="text">The card also points to the need to overcome inner fears, doubts, or insecurities. 
                You may be feeling uncertain about your future, but Strength asks you to face these emotions head-on. 
                Acknowledge your fears, but don’t let them control your actions. 
                Instead, use your inner power to push past them.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Gentle Power and Control</div>
            <div class="text">The Strength card is not about force or aggression, 
                but about controlling your emotions and reactions with a gentle, yet firm, approach. 
                This is a time to stay focused and consistent in your efforts, 
                but also to be kind and nurturing toward yourself as you navigate this transition.
