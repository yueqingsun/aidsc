        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Stagnation and Delay</div>
            <div class="text">The Wheel of Fortune reversed can indicate a feeling of 
                stagnation or that things are not moving as quickly as you would like. After losing your job, 
                you may be feeling stuck or frustrated by a lack of progress in your job search or personal life. 
                You might feel like you're hitting a wall or that things are not working out in your favor.</div>

            <div class="h3title">Unforeseen Challenges</div>
            <div class="text">This card can signify that external circumstances or factors beyond your control are delaying progress or making it harder to move forward. It could be that you're facing obstacles that are preventing you from securing a new job or advancing in your career. However, these challenges may not be permanent, and you may need to adjust your approach or expectations to navigate through them.

            <div class="h3title">Bad Luck or Timing Issues</div>
            <div class="text">The Wheel reversed often points to bad timing or events that feel unlucky. You may feel like your efforts aren't yielding results, and opportunities may not be presenting themselves when you need them. However, this card is a reminder that luck is cyclical and that these difficult times will pass—if you can keep moving forward.

            <div class="h3title">Embrace Flexibility</div>
            <div class="text">The Wheel reversed suggests a need for flexibility. If your job search or career path isn’t progressing as expected, try to shift your perspective.

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Focus on the Present Moment</div>
            <div class="text">Rather than focusing too much on the future or worrying about the lack of movement, The Wheel of Fortune reversed encourages you to focus on the present moment. Sometimes things take time to fall into place. By grounding yourself in the here and now, you may be able to find small, meaningful steps that can lead to bigger shifts.

            <div class="h3title">Let Go of Control</div>
            <div class="text">The reversed Wheel often signals a need to release control and trust that things will eventually move in your favor. There may be factors outside of your control, but this doesn’t mean you’re powerless. Accept that there are cycles of good and bad luck, and while this may be a down phase, the cycle will eventually turn in your favor again.

How can you use this time to improve yourself or your situation moving forward?

        <hr><h2>Final Thought</h2>
        <div class="text">The Wheel of Fortune reversed suggests that you may be in a period where things feel out of alignment, but this phase is temporary.
