        <hr><h2>Suggestions and Actions</h2>
        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Reconnect with Your Inner Voice</div>
            <div class="text">Make time for silence and solitude. Journaling, meditating, or practicing mindfulness can help clear mental clutter and reconnect you to your intuition.
                Pay attention to recurring thoughts, dreams, or feelings—they may hold important clues.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Investigate Hidden Influences</div>
            <div class="text">Look carefully at your situation. Are there facts, patterns, or opportunities you’ve overlooked?
                If something feels "off," trust your gut and dig deeper. 
                This might involve asking for clarification from others or reevaluating assumptions.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Seek Balance</div>
            <div class="text">Avoid becoming overly reliant on logic or emotion alone. Balance intuition with practical research to make informed decisions.
                Stay grounded and avoid letting external pressures push you into hasty or ill-advised choices.</div>

            <div class="h3title">Avoid Isolation</div>
            <div class="text">The reversed High Priestess can indicate withdrawing too much. While reflection is important, don’t hesitate to seek advice from trusted mentors, friends, or professionals.
                Collaborating with others can reveal insights you might not uncover alone.</div>

        <hr><h2>Final Thought</h2>
        <div class="text">The High Priestess reversed is a reminder to slow down, reflect, and trust in your ability to find clarity. 
            While the path forward may feel obscured, the answers are within reach. 
            Reconnect with your intuition, pay attention to hidden details, 
            and let this period of uncertainty guide you toward a more aligned and intentional future.</div>
