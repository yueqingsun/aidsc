            <div class="h3title">Resistance to Letting Go</div>
            <div class="text">You may be holding onto old ways of thinking, unhealthy attachments, or rigid expectations. This resistance could be preventing you from seeing new opportunities. The reversed Hanged Man suggests that letting go of these attachments is essential to moving forward.

            <div class="h3title">Feeling Stuck or Trapped</div>
            <div class="text">This card often represents a sense of stagnation, where you feel as though no matter what you do, progress is blocked. This can result from external circumstances, such as an unresponsive job market, or internal struggles, such as fear or self-doubt.

            <div class="h3title">Impatience and Avoidance</div>
            <div class="text">You might be in a hurry to find solutions without fully understanding the situation. The reversed Hanged Man warns against rushing decisions or avoiding the necessary inner work. Skipping the reflection phase could lead to short-term fixes that don’t address the root of the problem.

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Missed Opportunities for Insight</div>
            <div class="text">By resisting the pause and self-reflection that the upright Hanged Man calls for, you might miss valuable lessons or insights. This card encourages you to slow down and look inward, even if it feels uncomfortable or unproductive at first.

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Fear of Sacrifice</div>
