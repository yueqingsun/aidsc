        <hr><h2>Card Meaning and Analysis</h2>
        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Unhealthy Attachments</div>
            <div class="text">You may be holding onto something from your past—such as a toxic work environment, an unproductive habit, or even a negative mindset—that is preventing you from moving forward. These attachments need to be identified and addressed.

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Feelings of Powerlessness</div>
            <div class="text">The Devil can indicate a sense of being stuck or controlled by circumstances, such as financial stress or fear of the unknown. This card invites you to examine whether these limitations are truly external or if they stem from internal fears or doubts.

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Temptations and Shortcuts</div>
            <div class="text">You might feel tempted to take an easy but unwise path, such as accepting a job that doesn’t align with your values or resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms. Be cautious of decisions that provide short-term relief at the cost of long-term fulfillment.

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Self-Sabotage</div>
            <div class="text">The Devil can point to ways you may be sabotaging your own progress, such as procrastination, excessive worry, or falling into negative thinking. Recognizing these behaviors is the first step toward overcoming them.

            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Materialism and Fear</div>
            <div class="text">The Devil often highlights an overemphasis on material concerns, such as financial stability or societal expectations, that might be clouding your judgment. While these are valid concerns, focusing solely on them can limit your growth.

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Identify What’s Holding You Back</div>
            <div class="text">Reflect on what is keeping you stuck. Is it fear of failure? A sense of obligation to others? Attachments to old habits? Write these down and consider how you might release them.

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Challenge Limiting Beliefs</div>
            <div class="text">Pay attention to the stories you’re telling yourself. Are you convinced you’re unqualified for a new role? Do you believe you’ll never find a job as good as the last one? Replace these thoughts with more empowering beliefs.

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Avoid Temptations</div>
            <div class="text">Be mindful of quick fixes or compromises that might seem appealing but won’t serve your long-term goals. For example, taking a high-paying job in a toxic environment might seem practical but could harm your well-being.

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Take Back Control</div>
            <div class="text">The Devil reminds you that the power to break free is in your hands. Focus on actions within your control, like improving your skills, networking, or reframing your mindset. Small steps can help you regain a sense of agency.
