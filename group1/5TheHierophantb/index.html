            <div class="h3title">Challenging Tradition or Authority</div>
            <div class="text">The Hierophant reversed often indicates a rebellion against conventional authority, systems, or norms. 
                You might be feeling frustrated with traditional career paths or roles that no longer align with your personal goals or values. 
                It’s a time to question outdated expectations and find your own path.</div>

            <div class="text">This card suggests that the current structures (such as societal expectations, institutions, 
                or professional systems) might feel restrictive or stifling. 
                You may be feeling boxed in or constrained by the idea that you need to follow a certain protocol to find success or fulfillment.</div>

            <div class="text">You might be struggling to find the right guidance or mentorship, 
                feeling disconnected from people who can support you. It can also suggest that you are unwilling to seek or accept help from others, 
                possibly out of a desire for independence or a fear of being told what to do.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Reevaluating Beliefs and Values</div>

                especially those around career, work, and success. Are you following a path because it’s expected of you, 
                or because it aligns with your authentic self? 
                This card asks you to reconsider what truly resonates with you.</div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Alternative Learning Paths</div>
            <div class="text">This card often points to non-traditional learning or career paths.

                What do you truly want from your career or life?
