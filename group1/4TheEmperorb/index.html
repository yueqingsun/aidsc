            <div class="h3title">Lack of Control or Direction</div>
            <div class="text">The Emperor reversed signals that you may be feeling overwhelmed or powerless, 
                struggling with a lack of control over your current situation. 
                You might feel unsure about the next steps to take or how to organize your job search effectively.</div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Imbalance in Authority</div>
            <div class="text">This card may point to difficulties with authority figures, lack of guidance, 
                or feeling that others aren’t supporting you as you need. 
                It could also reflect a tendency to either overmanage or feel completely disconnected from the structure you need.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Self-Discipline Issues</div>
            <div class="text">You may be struggling with self-discipline or lack the structure necessary to take consistent action toward your goals. 
                The reversed Emperor can point to procrastination or a lack of focus that’s hindering progress.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Fear of Failure or Lack of Confidence</div>
            <div class="text">This card may indicate feelings of inadequacy, 
                where you might be doubting your ability to make decisions or succeed, 
                even though you have the potential to do so.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Rebellion or Defiance</div>
            <div class="text">Sometimes, the reversed Emperor points to rejecting authority, rules, or structures altogether. 
                This can either be an empowering rebellion or a sign of resistance that’s preventing you from finding a workable path forward.

        <hr><h2>Suggestions and Actions</h2>
        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Reclaim Control</div>
            <div class="text">The first step is to take back control of your life. 
                Start by organizing your job search, creating a clear plan, and setting achievable goals for yourself.
                Avoid feeling lost or overwhelmed by breaking down tasks into manageable chunks, 
                such as updating your resume, researching industries, or reaching out to connections.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Establish Boundaries</div>
            <div class="text">If you’re feeling overwhelmed by external influences, it’s important to set boundaries—whether it's in your personal life or work-related decisions.
                Focus on what you can control and give yourself permission to step back from situations or people that drain your energy.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Seek Support and Guidance</div>
            <div class="text">If you’re struggling with a lack of direction, 
                it might be helpful to find a mentor, career coach, or trusted advisor who can offer objective feedback and guidance.
                Don’t be afraid to ask for help from friends or family as you rework your plans and rebuild your confidence.
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Reevaluate Your Approach</div>
            <div class="text">Reflect on whether your approach to job hunting or career transition is too rigid or too scattered. 
                The reversed Emperor might indicate that you need to either become more disciplined or, 
                alternatively, allow more flexibility in your plans.
                Consider new ways to pursue career goals—perhaps being open to industries or roles that you hadn’t considered before.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Work on Building Confidence</div>
            <div class="text">Take small steps to rebuild your self-esteem and confidence. 
                This could involve practicing positive self-talk, celebrating small wins, 
                or seeking feedback from others to remind yourself of your strengths.
                Focus on your leadership qualities, even in smaller settings, 
                to remind yourself that you are capable of making decisions and taking charge of your future.</div>
        </div> 
        
        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Be Careful of Overcompensating</div>
            <div class="text">Watch for tendencies to over-control your situation out of fear or frustration. 
                Over-managing the process might create more stress or burnout.
                 Instead, give yourself some space for flexibility and self-compassion as you move forward.</div>
        </div> 
    </div>

    <div class="sec">
        <hr><h2>Final Thought</h2>
        <div class="text">The Emperor reversed invites you to reevaluate how you're handling your job search and life direction. 
            By regaining your confidence, reestablishing structure, and seeking support, you can regain control over your future. 
            This is a time to balance discipline with flexibility and make choices that empower you, rather than feeling helpless or stuck. 
            The path forward may require a shift in perspective, 
            but you have the ability to lead yourself back to stability. </div>
