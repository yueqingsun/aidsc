        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Introspection and Reflection</div>
            <div class="text">The Hermit upright suggests that now is the time to pause and reflect on your life and career. 
                Losing your job may have shaken you, but this card invites you to use this as an opportunity for self-discovery. 
                Take some time to reflect on what you truly want from your career and what your values are. 
                This could be a moment for deep personal growth and to reassess your goals.</div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Seeking Inner Wisdom</div>
            <div class="text">The Hermit represents the search for truth and understanding. 
                It suggests that the answers to your questions about your next steps are not necessarily found outside of you but within. 
                You may need to spend time alone, meditating or journaling, 
                to uncover your deeper desires and find the path that resonates with your authentic self.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Solitude and Withdrawal</div>
            <div class="text">The Hermit often calls for solitude. 
                It’s a time to withdraw from the noise of the world and focus on your inner life. 
                You may need a period of solitude to recharge emotionally and mentally after the loss of your job. 
                This time of withdrawal is not about isolation but about finding clarity through quiet reflection.

            <div class="text">This card also speaks to the value of experience and wisdom. 
                It encourages you to trust your own knowledge and insights gained from your past work experiences. 
                You may already have the tools and wisdom needed to move forward, 
                but you need to take a step back to recognize them.</div>

            <div class="h3title">Guidance and Mentorship</div>

                it can also suggest that you may seek guidance from a trusted mentor or advisor who has walked a similar path. 
                This could be a time to connect with someone who can offer sage advice or help you see things from a different perspective.
