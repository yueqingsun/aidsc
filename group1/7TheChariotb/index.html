        <hr><h2>Card Meaning and Analysis</h2>
        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Lack of Direction or Focus</div>
            <div class="text">The Chariot reversed often signals confusion or a lack of direction. 
                After losing your job, you may feel uncertain about your next steps or unsure of the career path you should take. 
                This indecisiveness can cause delays or hinder your ability to make progress. 
                The card urges you to reorient yourself and gain clarity before charging forward.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Internal Conflict</div>
            <div class="text">This card can point to inner conflict or a lack of self-confidence. 
                You may be struggling with your own doubts or fears, making it hard to take decisive action. 
                The Chariot reversed indicates that there may be emotional blocks or unresolved issues that 
                are preventing you from fully committing to a new direction.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Imbalance or Loss of Control</div>
            <div class="text">The Chariot is about control, both of the external environment and your internal state. 
                When reversed, it suggests that you may feel out of control, as if things are moving too fast or too slowly. 
                You might be experiencing frustration due to external circumstances, 
                or you may be struggling to balance different aspects of your life, 
                such as work, personal needs, or emotions.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Difficulty Overcoming Obstacles</div>
            <div class="text">Unlike the upright Chariot, which represents triumph over challenges, 
                the reversed version can point to difficulty overcoming obstacles. 
                It may feel like the barriers in your path are too big to handle or that you lack the resources or energy to push through them. 
                This is a sign to reassess your strategy and approach.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Need for Patience and Reflection</div>
            <div class="text">The Chariot reversed may indicate that rushing ahead is not the best course of action. 
                It encourages you to take a step back, slow down, and reflect. 
                Instead of forcing things to happen, focus on gaining clarity about your goals and what truly motivates you. 
                This period of reflection will help you regain focus and realign your actions.

            <div class="text">Take time to clarify what you want from your career and life. 
                This may involve reassessing your values, interests, and goals.

            <div class="h3title">Address Internal Conflicts</div>
            <div class="text">If you’re feeling unsure of yourself, take some time to explore the reasons behind your doubts. 
                It might be helpful to speak with a mentor, coach, or counselor to work through your fears or insecurities. 
                Gaining a better understanding of what’s holding you back will empower you to move forward with confidence.</div>
        </div>

            <div class="h3title">Regain Control</div>
            <div class="text">If you’re feeling overwhelmed, focus on areas where you can regain control. 
                This could mean organizing your job search, setting smaller goals, or reestablishing routines to bring structure to your life. 
                Take charge of what you can, and let go of things that are beyond your control.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="info">

            <div class="text">The Chariot reversed encourages patience. You may need to reassess your approach to job hunting, 
                networking, or career development. It’s not the time to rush into the first opportunity that comes your way; instead, 
                reflect on what would be a true fit for you in the long run.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Deal with Obstacles One Step at a Time</div>
            <div class="text">Break down challenges into manageable steps. 
                If you’re facing obstacles, focus on overcoming one issue at a time instead of feeling overwhelmed by the bigger picture. 
                By handling smaller tasks, you will regain confidence and momentum.</div>
        </div> 
    </div>

    <div class="sec">
        <hr><h2>Final Thought</h2>
        <div class="text">The Chariot reversed suggests that this is a time to slow down, reassess your situation, 
            and regain clarity. Rather than forcing progress, focus on overcoming internal conflicts and gaining control over your circumstances. 
            With patience and reflection, you’ll be able to move forward with renewed strength and a clearer sense of direction. 
            Take your time, regroup, and remember that you can steer your life and career back on course with the right focus and strategy.</div>
