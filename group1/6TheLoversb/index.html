            <div class="text">The Lovers reversed often represents a difficult choice or a situation where 
                you’re feeling torn between multiple options. 
                You may be uncertain about which path to take or may feel confused about what you truly want from your career. 
                This indecision can cause delays or a lack of progress in your job search.

            <div class="h3title">Misalignment with Your True Self</div>
            <div class="text">The reversed Lovers suggests a disconnection between your actions and your authentic desires. 
                You might be pursuing job opportunities that don’t fully align with your values or passions. 
                This can lead to feelings of dissatisfaction or frustration in the long run.</div>

            <div class="text">This card can indicate tension or disconnection in your relationships, 
                especially when it comes to seeking support during your job search. You might be feeling isolated, unsupported, 
                or misunderstood by those around you. 
                Alternatively, conflicts with colleagues, family, or mentors could be impacting your ability to make clear decisions.</div>

                where you may be hesitant to fully invest in a new career direction or opportunity. 
                You might feel unsure about committing to the next step, 
                possibly due to a fear of failure or a lack of confidence in the decision-making process.</div>

                You may be grappling with conflicting desires—perhaps you want a career that offers stability,

                Avoid staying in a state of limbo. If you're uncertain, take small steps toward one direction, 
                trusting that clarity will come as you move forward. If you're stuck,

            <div class="text">If you're feeling unsupported, reach out to people who can offer guidance,
                 such as mentors or friends. Be open about your challenges and work through any conflicts or misunderstandings. 
                 If you’ve been avoiding seeking help, 
                now is the time to build a support system that can give you clarity and encouragement.</div>

                you think you should do and what you truly want to do. Take time to reflect on what feels authentic to you. 
                Consider journaling, meditation, 
                or speaking with someone you trust to help clarify your own feelings.</div>
