        <hr><h2>Card Meaning and Analysis</h2>
        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Avoiding Introspection</div>
            <div class="text">The Hermit reversed can indicate that you are avoiding looking inward. 
                You may be feeling overwhelmed or anxious about your job loss, 
                which is causing you to distract yourself from reflecting on your true desires and goals. 
                This avoidance may be preventing you from gaining the clarity you need to move forward.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Feeling Isolated or Lonely</div>
            <div class="text">This card may also suggest feelings of isolation, loneliness, or alienation. 
                The Hermit reversed can represent a sense of disconnection from others or from your own inner wisdom. 
                You might feel like you're in a dark or confusing place, 
                unsure of how to navigate your next steps or how to reach out for help.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Over-Reliance on External Advice</div>
            <div class="text">The Hermit reversed could indicate that you are seeking answers and guidance from external sources, 
                rather than trusting your own intuition. While it’s natural to want advice, 
                this card suggests that relying too heavily on others’ opinions 
                may be clouding your judgment and preventing you from finding your own path forward.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Stagnation and Lack of Direction</div>
            <div class="text">If you feel stuck or directionless after losing your job, 
                The Hermit reversed could be a sign that you need to take a break from the external pressures and focus on finding clarity within. 
                You may be moving aimlessly, not knowing where to go next, 
                but this card urges you to stop for a moment and reflect on where you truly want to head.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Emotional Burnout or Exhaustion</div>
            <div class="text">The Hermit reversed can also point to emotional burnout. 
                Perhaps you’ve been withdrawing too much from others, pushing yourself too hard, 
                or suppressing your emotions, which has left you feeling drained or disconnected. 
                You may need to rest and replenish your energy before you can effectively move forward.

        <hr><h2>Suggestions and Actions</h2>
        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Reconnect with Yourself</div>
            <div class="text">The reversed Hermit calls for you to take a step back from external 
                distractions and reconnect with your inner self. Spend some quiet time alone, 
                even if it’s just for a few minutes a day. Reflect on your values, passions, and what you truly want for your future. 
                Introspection is important, and it’s time to listen to your inner voice.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Seek Balance Between Solitude and Connection</div>
            <div class="text">While The Hermit reversed may indicate too much isolation, 
                it's also important to find a balance. While solitude is valuable for reflection, 
                connecting with trusted friends, family, or a mentor can help you regain perspective. 
                Don't be afraid to seek help or guidance from others, 
                but ensure that you are also honoring your own thoughts and needs.

        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Trust Your Own Wisdom</div>
            <div class="text">Rather than relying too much on external opinions or advice, 
                take time to trust your own wisdom and insights. The answers you seek about your next steps may be within you, 
                but you need to take the time to listen. 
                Try journaling, meditating, 
                or simply sitting quietly to help bring clarity and reconnect with your inner wisdom.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Address Feelings of Isolation or Loneliness</div>
            <div class="text">If you are feeling isolated or disconnected, 
                it might be helpful to reach out to others. Engage with friends, family, 
                or support groups to share your thoughts and feelings. 
                You may also find that seeking professional guidance, such as career counseling or therapy, 
                can provide clarity and help you feel less alone during this time of transition.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Take Small Steps Toward Clarity</div>
            <div class="text">If you feel overwhelmed or unsure of where to go next, take small, manageable steps. 
                Focus on one action at a time, such as updating your resume, exploring career options, 
                or learning a new skill. The Hermit reversed suggests that you don't need to have everything figured out right away, 
                but you should begin taking steps in the direction of clarity.</div>

        <hr><h2>Final Thought</h2>
        <div class="text">The Hermit reversed suggests that while you may be struggling with confusion or a sense of isolation, 
            this is an invitation to reconnect with yourself and seek clarity through introspection. 
            Avoid distractions, trust your own wisdom, and take small steps toward regaining direction. 
            By doing so, you will gradually break through the confusion and find a path forward that aligns with your authentic self. 
            Don’t rush; this process takes time, 
            but your inner guidance will eventually lead you to the answers you seek.</div>
