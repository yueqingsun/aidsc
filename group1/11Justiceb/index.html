        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Unfairness and Injustice</div>
            <div class="text">Justice reversed suggests a sense of injustice, either because you feel wronged or because decisions have been made that don’t seem fair. Losing your job might have felt sudden, unfair, or not based on merit, and this card asks you to examine whether there is an aspect of the situation that has been handled dishonestly or with bias. There may also be lingering feelings of resentment or frustration regarding how things unfolded.

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Lack of Accountability</div>
            <div class="text">This card may indicate that there has been a lack of accountability, either from yourself or from others involved. If you feel that your job loss was due to factors beyond your control—such as company politics, personal biases, or unfair treatment—Justice reversed encourages you to confront these issues and seek resolution, whether through dialogue, legal channels, or personal reflection.

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Ignoring the Truth or Avoidance</div>
            <div class="text">Justice reversed may point to a situation where the truth has been ignored or where there’s a tendency to avoid facing uncomfortable realities. Perhaps there are aspects of the situation that you haven’t fully processed, or you’re not confronting the full scope of your job loss. It’s important to face the truth, even if it’s difficult, in order to make informed decisions going forward.

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Imbalance and Disharmony</div>
            <div class="text">The reversed card can represent a feeling of imbalance or things not aligning as they should. You may feel like you’re putting in more effort than you're receiving in return, or that things aren't falling into place. This might indicate that something in your life or your approach to the job search needs to be rebalanced to regain a sense of fairness and alignment.

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Karmic Lessons or Consequences</div>
            <div class="text">The reversed Justice card can also be a reminder that there are karmic lessons to be learned. If the job loss was due to your own actions or mistakes, this card asks you to take responsibility and understand the consequences. However, it can also indicate that others involved (like your employer) may need to take accountability for their part in the situation.

            <div class="h3title">Reflect on Possible Unfairness</div>
            <div class="text">If you feel that your job loss was unjust, take some time to reflect on the reasons behind this. Were there biases or decisions that were not transparent or fair? If there’s something you can do about it (such as seeking clarity or legal advice), now is the time to explore your options. Standing up for what’s right could help restore balance to the situation.

            <div class="h3title">Face the Truth</div>
            <div class="text">It’s important to face any uncomfortable truths in your situation. Are there areas where you may have been avoiding responsibility or where you could have acted differently? The reversed Justice card invites you to take a hard look at your own actions and decisions to ensure you're not overlooking something important. It’s time to address what has been ignored or put off.

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Take Responsibility and Move Forward</div>
            <div class="text">If there are aspects of your job loss that involve your own choices or actions, this card asks you to take responsibility for them. Avoiding this responsibility may keep you stuck. Acknowledge what you can control and focus on how you can move forward. Make fair, balanced decisions about how to handle the situation moving forward.

        <div class="info">
            <div class="h3title">Seek Clarity and Communication</div>
            <div class="text">If your job loss feels unjust, it may help to seek clarity. Have a conversation with your former employer or HR department to better understand the reasoning behind the decision. If there are areas where you feel mistreated or misinformed, it’s important to have an open discussion or to consider your options in terms of seeking a resolution.

            <div class="h3title">Rebalance Your Life</div>
            <div class="text">The reversed Justice card often indicates that there’s an imbalance somewhere in your life. Perhaps you’ve been giving too much to your job or not prioritizing your own well-being. Now is the time to rebalance your life. Focus on what truly matters, whether that’s improving your work-life balance, taking care of your health, or reevaluating your career goals.

Whether the imbalance lies within yourself, the situation, or external forces, addressing these issues with honesty and integrity will help restore balance and guide you toward a more just and fulfilling outcome.
